logical AND and logical OR uses short-circuit evaluation method. They evaluate the condition on the right only when the left side satisfies the expectation for moving on.  
  
equality operators operate as expected, with exception that when comparing a number value to bool, bool will be first converted in to integer 0 or 1. It is wiser to just evaluate ``value`` or ``!value``
