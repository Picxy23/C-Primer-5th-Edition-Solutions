If it is left assosiative, you will not be able to embed conditions in conditions.  
``(grade > 90 ? "high pass" : **(grade < 60)**) ? "fail" : "pass";``  
Would be evaluated, and if input is say ``61``, ``(grade < 60)`` returns a bool which would fail the condition statement, as you need two same type expressions.
