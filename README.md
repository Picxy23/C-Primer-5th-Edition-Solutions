# C-Primer-5th-Edition-Solutions
- Solutions to Primer's practice problems, from Chapter 3.
- Chapter 1 needs no solution. Chapter 2 is datatype, not many coding questions (I might go back to redo those too and upload...)
- Origional solutions completed by imature student at self-studying pace. Solutions would be close to beginner's logics.
- Made this to record my progress and to provide a reference for who can't understand other contributer's solutions or to help with missing/incomplete solution.
