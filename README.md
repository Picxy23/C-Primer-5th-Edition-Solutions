# C-Primer-5th-Edition-Solutions
- Solutions to Primer's practice problems, from Chapter 3.
- Chapter 1 needs no solution. Chapter 2 is datatype, not many coding questions (I might go back to redo those too and upload...)
- Completed by imature student at self-studying pace. Solutions would be close to beginner's logics.
